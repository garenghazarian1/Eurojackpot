🎰 Eurojackpot Number Analyzer – A Smart Approach to Winning! 🚀
Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on an intelligent Eurojackpot number analyzer that helps analyze past draw results, track number frequencies, and generate strategic number combinations based on different methods:

✅ 🔥 Hot Numbers – Picks the most frequently drawn numbers.
✅ ❄️ Cold Numbers – Selects numbers that haven’t appeared much.
✅ 🎯 Balanced Strategy – A mix of both hot and cold numbers with additional balancing rules.

💡 Features of the App:
🔢 Dynamic Input Handling – No more static text! Easily enter and edit past draws using intuitive input fields.
📊 Visual Frequency Charts – Analyzes number trends and displays them in an interactive chart.
🎲 Smart Combination Generator – Uses real-time calculations to predict number patterns.
